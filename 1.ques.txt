1.write the steps using git how to push a file in bitbucket/gitlab/github ?

sol. The steps for pushing a file to a Git repository hosted on Bitbucket, GitLab or GitHub using Git:

step 1:
First, navigate to the local Git repository where you have the file you want to push

step 2:
Make sure that you have initialized Git in this repository by running the "git init" command if it hasn't been done already.

step 3:
Use the "git add" command to stage the file for commit. For example, if you want to stage a file called "example.txt", you would run the command "git add example.txt".

step 4:
Run the "git commit" command to commit the changes. For example, if you want to commit the changes to "example.txt", you would run the command 'git commit -m "Add example.txt"'.

step 5:
Next, you need to add a remote repository to Git. To do this, run the command "git remote add origin <remote repository URL>". Replace "<remote repository URL>" with the URL of your remote repository on Bitbucket, GitLab or GitHub. For example, if your remote repository is on GitHub, the URL might look something like "https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git".

step 6:
After adding the remote repository, you can use the "git push" command to push your local changes to the remote repository. For example, if you want to push your changes to the master branch, you would run the command "git push origin master". If you have set up your repository to use a different branch, you would replace master with the name of your branch.

 Your file should now be pushed to your Git repository on Bitbucket, GitLab or GitHub.
